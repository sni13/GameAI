# CSC384H1F Assignments Repository

This repository is a collection of assignments for the CSC384H1F course, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. Each assignment focuses on a core concept of artificial intelligence, ranging from search algorithms to probabilistic models.

## Assignment Overviews

- **Assignment 1: Search Algorithms**
  - This assignment delves into the implementation and analysis of search algorithms in AI, demonstrating how these algorithms enable intelligent decision-making.

- **Assignment 2: Game Tree Search**
  - Here we explore the application of game tree search strategies, specifically in the context of competitive environments and games.

- **Assignment 3: CSP Battleship**
  - This assignment focuses on constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), using the game of Battleship as a study for CSP modeling and solution strategies.

- **Assignment 4: HMM Part-of-Speech Tagging**
  - The final assignment investigates the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for part-of-speech tagging, a fundamental task in natural language processing.
